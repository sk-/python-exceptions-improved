python-exceptions-improved
==========================

This experimental module aims to ease the debugging when running tests.
It also serves as a proof of concept for the Enhance Exception PEP proposal.

Note that this module is highly experimental and it outputs lots of data, which could be used by an attacker to cause a DOS.
Use it at your own risk.

You can run the example by doing:

::

    cd examples
    test-exceptions-wrapper.py example
